GoldStar — Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Tagline: Earn Gold for Your Grades
1. Product Overview
GoldStar is a student-facing platform that turns verified academic performance into immediate, tangible rewards funded by community sponsors.
Students earn rewards for their grades today — not years later — while schools provide trusted verification and local businesses invest directly in student success.
This PRD focuses on alignment and clarity, not exhaustive documentation. It defines what we are building and why, scoped tightly to an MVP.

2. Problem Statement
Grades feel meaningless to many students.
Students study, take exams, and work hard — but the payoff is abstract and delayed. College, careers, and scholarships feel far away, while day-to-day needs and motivations are immediate.
As a result:
Capable students disengage
Academic effort is undervalued in the short term
Motivation drops, especially for students who could succeed but don’t see the point


At the same time:
Parents and communities want to support students


Schools want positive incentives without financial burden


Existing reward systems are informal, delayed, or untrusted


Core problem:
There is no trusted, scalable way to reward academic effort in the moment.

3. Target Users
Primary Users
Middle school & high school students (Grades 6–12)


Secondary Users
Schools (administrators, counselors, or teachers as verifiers)


Community sponsors (local businesses, donors)


Parents / guardians (indirect stakeholders)


User Context
Students need motivation that feels fair, achievable, and real


Schools require low administrative overhead


Sponsors want verified impact, not self-reported claims



4. Product Goals & Success Criteria
Product Goals
Increase student motivation through short-term, verified rewards


Create a trusted loop: effort → verification → reward


Enable community participation without school funding


Success Looks Like
Students consistently submit grades


Rewards are redeemed quickly after verification


Sponsors return to fund additional reward pools


No verified fraud or abuse during pilot



5. Current Alternatives & Gaps
How This Is Solved Today
Parents offer informal rewards


Schools provide recognition (honor roll, certificates)


Scholarships reward long-term performance


Why These Fall Short
Rewards are inconsistent and subjective


Recognition is delayed and symbolic


No transparent, scalable system exists



6. Proposed Solution (High-Level)
GoldStar provides a platform where:
Student grades are verified by schools


Rewards unlock based on clear GPA tiers


Funding comes from community sponsors


Students redeem rewards immediately


Value Proposition
Students: Academic effort finally feels worth it now


Schools: Trusted validation without paying


Sponsors: Visible, verified community impact
