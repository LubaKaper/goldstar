# ⭐ GoldStar
### Earn Gold for Your Grades

## Overview

**GoldStar** is a student-facing platform that turns **verified academic performance into immediate, tangible rewards** funded by community sponsors.

Students earn rewards for their grades **today — not years later**.  
Schools provide trusted verification.  
Local businesses and donors invest directly in student success.

This repository documents the **MVP product definition** for GoldStar. It is intentionally scoped to validate a single core question before scaling.

---

## Why I Built This

I built GoldStar to explore whether short-term, verified incentives can meaningfully change student motivation.

---

Traditional academic rewards are delayed and abstract. This project experiments with a different assumption: that motivation improves when effort is acknowledged immediately and transparently, with community support instead of institutional funding.

GoldStar is intentionally scoped as an MVP to test this idea before expanding into more complex systems.

## Project Status

🟡 **MVP / Concept Validation**

GoldStar is currently in the MVP definition phase. The goal is to validate whether **immediate, verified rewards meaningfully increase student motivation** before expanding functionality or integrations.

---

## Problem

Grades often feel meaningless to students.

Students study, take exams, and work hard — but the payoff is abstract and delayed. College, careers, and scholarships feel far away, while day-to-day needs and motivation are immediate.

As a result:
- Capable students disengage
- Academic effort is undervalued in the short term
- Motivation drops, especially for students who could succeed but don’t see the point

At the same time:
- Parents and communities want to support students
- Schools want positive incentives without financial burden
- Existing reward systems are informal, delayed, or untrusted

**Core problem:**  
There is no trusted, scalable way to reward academic effort *in the moment*.

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- Middle school & high school students (Grades 6–12)

### Secondary Users
- Schools (administrators, counselors, or teachers as verifiers)
- Community sponsors (local businesses, donors)
- Parents / guardians (indirect stakeholders)

---

## User Context & Constraints

- Students need motivation that feels **fair, achievable, and real**
- Schools require **low administrative overhead**
- Sponsors want **verified impact**, not self-reported claims

---

## How It Works (MVP)

1. Student creates an account
2. Student submits grades for a grading period
3. School verifies the submission
4. System assigns a reward tier
5. Student redeems a reward funded by sponsors

---

## Proposed Solution

GoldStar provides a platform where:
- Student grades are verified by schools
- Rewards unlock based on clear GPA tiers
- Funding comes from community sponsors
- Students redeem rewards immediately after verification

---

## Value Proposition

- **Students:** Academic effort finally feels worth it *now*
- **Schools:** Trusted validation without paying
- **Sponsors:** Visible, verified community impact

---

## MVP Scope & Functional Requirements

This MVP is designed to validate the **core loop**, not to scale.

### Student Experience
- Create an account
- Submit grades for a grading period
- View verification status
- Unlock reward tiers after verification:
  - **Gold:** 90–100
  - **Silver:** 85–89
  - **Bronze:** 75–84
- View and redeem available rewards
- View basic reward history

### School / Verifier Experience
- Review grade submissions
- Approve or reject submissions
- Verification action unlocks rewards

### Sponsor Experience
- Create an account
- Contribute funds to a reward pool
- View high-level impact:
  - Number of students rewarded
  - Total funds distributed

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope (MVP)

- Leaderboards or public rankings
- Gamification (streaks, badges beyond tiers)
- AI-based grade analysis
- Full SIS or district-level integrations
- Automatic grade syncing  
  *(manual verification only for MVP)*

---

## Risks & Considerations

- Equity concerns (absolute performance vs improvement)
- Avoiding unhealthy competition
- Minimizing school workload
- Preventing fraud without complex systems
- Ensuring rewards support learning rather than distract from it

---

## Success Metrics (MVP Validation)

- Percentage of students who submit grades more than once
- Reward redemption rate
- Sponsor repeat contributions
- Verification turnaround time
- Fraud or dispute incidents (target: **zero**)

---

## MVP Philosophy

GoldStar’s MVP exists to answer one question:

> **Do immediate, verified rewards meaningfully increase student motivation?**

If the answer is **yes**, future iterations can expand into:
- Deeper school integrations
- Improvement-based rewards
- Long-term sponsorship programs
